Beasts #7: A todo list in which every todo can have its own nested todos.

Any todo can have any number of nested todos. Each todo has the ability to be added, deleted, edited, and marked as completed.Â This code is based off of the TodoMVC app.js and index.html version in which both jQuery and Handlebars have already been removed.
